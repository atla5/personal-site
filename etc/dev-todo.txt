CONVERSION TO SINGLE PAGE
-update all pages to simply reload the content area moderated in 'index.html'.
-like 'http://www.se.rit.edu/~dkrutz/index.html'
 using 'https://github.com/dan7800/workwebsite/blob/master/index.html' (do have permission)
-this will prevent having to reload the header and footer every time. we'll see about the 
 urls. might be 

LANDING PAGES
 design main pages for home, about, software, philosophy, blog, and library. and how a single
 entry in each of these pages will look. 
 
EXTERNAL APIs
-investigate possible APIs and external tools to enrich content and expand toolset:
->linked in and social networks for about page
->librarything, goodreads, or amazon.com API for 'library' page
->blogging could be a very annoying and possibly not all too enlightening task that has been
  done the world over. find a way to integrate that into the system.
->add a dropdown with a gravatar whenever you click my name in the top left.
->google analytics
->twitter

SCRIPTED BLOG ENTRIES (.txt to .php) 
-craft a rather basic shell script to take in a .txt file and spit out a .php usable by the site
 (this will allow me to write freely and prevent me from having to rewrite the includes and html
 tags manually for every new page and blog post)
->create a basic template .php file (with html tags, include, and open body) and simply parse 
  the text inside the file line by line converting it to .html while keeping formatting... 
  someone has almost certainly done this already with markup, find and adapt that.
->create a standardized format for these .txt files specifying type, tags, destination, etc.
->'-t' tag for adding a custom title to the created webpage. otherwise default to the filename
  before the extension (e.g. "about.txt" -> "Aidan Sawyer | About", "unix-philosophy.txt" ->
  "Aidan Sawyer | Unix Philosophy")...
->'-i' interactive mode might make some sense for individual files and would save from having
  to format each individual file with the section of the blog it goes to and what tags are 
  associated with it.

CUSTOM DOMAIN
-decide upon and purchase domain name,
-figure out hosting situation,
-place a redirect on rit-hosted site

TAGGING SYSTEM
-develop some sort of tagging system to make the search bar actually mean something. 
->smart tags for songs and books that link to other articles
->intelligent sidebar that loads relevant information from within (or without) subdomain
