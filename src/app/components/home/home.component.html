  <h4>About Me</h4>

  <!-- basic introduction -->
  <p>
    My name is Aidan Sawyer. I'm a Software Engineering major and Philosophy Minor
    at the <a href="www.rit.edu">Rochester Institute of Technology</a>.
  </p>

  <!-- github and carrer -->
  <p>
    My goal and purpose on <a href="https://github.com/atla5">GitHub</a>
    and in my career is to contribute to and create projects that serve to
    increase the efficiency, speed, and capacity of the engine of scholarship
    and knowledge production that drives human achievement.
  </p>

  <p>
    My current implementation of that goal has me working with various tools to
    assist with library automation tasks centered around digitization and
