  <h2>The Adapter Pattern</h2>
  <h3>Aidan Sawyer</h3>
  
  <p>
    The adapter pattern is meant to unify two disparate systems in a pure input 
    output method by means of a common interface. Adapters are useful in quickly
    communicating between two systems, protocols, or file types that share a lot 
    of information or functionality.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Adapters are limited in that they are devoted to the specific task of 
    translation and not designed for the addition of any functionality.  
    When daisy-chained or over-used, they may present a hazard to readability 
    and/or processing speed. They should only be used in the event that you are 
    trying to bridge two external formats or data streams.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It is used very commonly in converting file/data types, for example: XML 
    and JSON, or .docx to .rtf. Another very common use is in utilizing APIs. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Check the inspector to view a code snippet (adapter.js). In this example, one
    function "readData" links together two disparate formats (comma-separated and 
    period-separated strings).
