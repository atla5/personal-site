  <h2>The Mediator Pattern</h2>
  <h3>Aidan Sawyer</h3>
  
  <p>
    The mediator pattern is meant to orchestrate how a given set of disparate 
    objects (colleagues) interact with one another. It is helpful in that it 
    promotes loose coupling, converting what would be a bunch of intensive 
    many-to-many relationships into a less coupled many-to-one relationship. 
    In taking over this task for the many colleagues, it also helps in consolidating
    programming logic, and for increasing security, as it creates a single point 
    of entry which can be more heavily fortified and concentrated on. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    One of the main problems with the Mediator class is its tendency to bloat 
    and take over too much responsibility. As the number of colleagues its 
    mediating and the complexity and frequency of their requests increase, 
    there is also a potential for bottleneck. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The mediator pattern is often used in many things from chat features to 
    VoIP routing to elevators; anywhere involving a large number of small 
    things that need to communicate.

    Check the inspector to view a code snippet (mediator.js). It uses the common
    example of a cell tower, orchestrating the communications between phones. 
    Though this specific implementation is limited, it is easy to see that with
    more complex phone behavior (like SMS, call duration, concurrency), the 
    mediator "Tower" becomes increasingly beneficial, coordinating all the major
    functions in one place.
