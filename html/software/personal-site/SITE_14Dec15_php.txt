site status: the site now has a header and a footer that can be added and functional on every 
  page with one line each.

problems: 
-existing file structure is wonky and uses relative paths. both need to be fixed at some point. 
->apparently the php includes are pretty dumb under the hood, so the link I had in the .inc.php
  file is broken by a relative path error. I could solve this temporarily with the bootstrap
  CDN links on getbootstrap.com, but this will just grow into a bigger problem as the site grows.

comments:
-first experience with php, via includes. pretty interesting.
-using 'xampp' to serve my site on localhost via the 'htdocs/<subfolder-name-here>' folder
-pretty surprised how easy the web stuff is to do from the ground up.
-more surprised at how much of a frenzy of languages it seems to be. php, js, css, html all 
 in one file and/or spread throughout a load of directories.

learned:
-php is a serverside language that you can do pretty powerful stuff with
->includes can drastically decrease code duplication with very little cost
->sending arguments via the url
