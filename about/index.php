  <p>
    I am a Software Engineering (SE) and Philosophy double major at the
    Rochester Institute of Technology.
  </p>

  <p>
    My interests in SE center around design, architecture, relational databases,
      and backend development.
  </p>

  <p>
    My interests in philosophy focus predominantly on Epistemology and its close
    relationship to Ethics. I am, however, deeply interested in Aesthetics and
    the history of art as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    Joining the two is a growing interest in Library Science and the life's goal
    to both aid in and gain from the tremendous opportunities technology affords
    to the organization, compilation, and propagation of the collected grand sum
    of human knowledge.

    In my spare time I enjoy reading and buying books. I manage my library with 
    <a href="https://www.librarything.com/" target="_blank">librarything</a>.
    A link to my personal library is available <a href="https://www.librarything.com/catalog/aidan.keefe.s/yourlibrary" 
                   target="_blank" >here</a>.
