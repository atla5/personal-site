        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is <strong>Aidan Sawyer</strong>. I'm a <strong>Web Developer</strong>, Brewer, Distiller, bartender,
          and fireman with a great appreciation for simplicity, interoperability, and <strong>separation of concerns</strong>. 
        </p>

        <p>
          I think everything is better crafted when done both <strong>with an earnest interest/investment in its purpose</strong> and 
          <strong>from within a pretty deep knowledge of the context for its use</strong>. I try to hold myself to these measures
          throughout my life.  
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Software is a powerful tool</strong> for communicating and facilitating ideas and supporting work across any number of industries.
          While it's not my only calling and interest, it's a means of expression and a way to dabble and explore interesting ideas,
          support my other work (and future family), and to maintain my skills over time. 
        </p>

        <p>
          I spent much of my early career working at positions in and around <strong>academic research and libraries</strong>. 
          We live in a world replete with information and media in any number of fields, and finding ways to organize,
          access, enjoy, parse, and discuss them remains a challenging and important problem for our age. 
          I retain much reverence for the goals and principles at the foundation of Library and Information Sciences, but ended up 
          finding the practical inner-workings of institutional libraries rather lackluster and ended up pursuing other avenues.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've <strong>spent the last couple years exploring</strong> emergency response, writing, hiking/orienteering, and in 
          craft beverage creation for what they provide in space and time and human experience. I intend to get back into software 
          for my previous interest in cataloguing and preservation as well as craft beverage production, and 
          potentially emergency response. Time will tell where all I'll go.  
        </p>
        
        <h2>How I Work</h2>
        <p>
          When working with software, I tend to seek, wherever possible, to push the boundaries of what can 
          be done with <strong>the web platform itself</strong>, <em>without</em> defaulting 
          to large <a href="https://technostacks.com/blog/javascript-frameworks/">frameworks-of-the-day</a>, 
          overly-elaborate and complicated <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack">build systems</a>, 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell">extraneous libraries</a>, 
          and even <em>vanilla</em> javascript or CSS.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are many guiding design principles in support of <strong>why I do this</strong>, 
           but the most directly applicable term I've found so far is called the 
          <strong><a href="https://github.com/bulib/bulib-wc/wiki/Principle-of-Least-Power">principle of least power</a></strong>.
          It basically says, don't use a fancy, new <em>sledge</em>-hammer when a trusty, regular old handheld one will do the job.
        </p>

        <p>I follow this principle for a <strong>number of reasons</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I want to <strong>learn the <em>web itself</em></strong>, not a fashionable (but fleeting) abstraction on top of it</li>
          <li>I want the capabilities of the <strong>web platform to grow</strong> and compound over time</li>
          <li>I want my work to be more <strong>performant, accessible, and interoperable</strong></li>
          <li>I want the skills that I learn to <strong>remain useful</strong> over my entire career</li>
          <li>I want to ensure (for myself and for others) that <strong>my work lasts</strong> (doesn't break)</li>
          <li>I want my want the <a href="/?page=projects">projects</a> I work on to be <strong>easy to maintain, update, and predict</strong></li>
          <li>I find it <strong>challenging and engaging</strong> to test the capacities of the base layer, to see what it can already do</li>
        </ul>

        <aside>Esoteric References and Complaints About the Librarianship and Software Industries</aside>
        <p>
          I'll permit myself <strong>a self-indulgent diversion</strong>, here. I left working for institutions for a variety of reasons
          related to a lack of fidelity to what I viewed as their main calling and purpose. It was always meant to be 
          temporary, but I became interested in other things along the way. I should write about this at some point 
          at greater depth, but here are some breadcrumbs for you or I to follow through on (or not) later.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>software industry</strong> spends billions of dollars chasing money and building tchotchkes for ad revenue and click-bait 
          at the shortest time-scale possible. <strong>University Libraries</strong> shovel tens of millions (each) outsourcing away their content, 
          metadata, and expertise, then buying back temporary access to it with little knowledge of how it's used.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're sitting on <strong>the greatest invention for storing and accessing human knowledge ever invented</strong>. 
          It's sad we're selling that for pottage, and I didn't want to watch from so close anymore. The web deserves a better class of stewards.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Anyway, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/554764">Tim Berners Lee</a> has some super interesting ideas about 
          how the internet could have gone if universities and research institutions had <strong>retained proper interest</strong> in the project 
          they started. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Stewart Brand and the <a href="https://longnow.org/about/">Long Now Foundation</a> have some really
          <strong>fantastic work</strong> that both mainstream librarianship and web development could learn a whole hell of a lot from
          and which should be informing "our" work from the very begining. He introduces the concept of 
          <a href="https://longnow.org/seminars/02015/jan/27/pace-layers-thinking/">Pace Layers</a> which work
          very closely into some of the rationale for why I work how I do and why I stepped away. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Ted Nelson's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu">"Project Xanadu"</a> is an 
          <strong>incredibly beautiful and deeply fascinating</strong> take on a vastly different way the internet could have gone. 
          His ideas are certainly worth (more than) an afternoon of exploring.
        </p>
